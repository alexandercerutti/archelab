# archelab - Computer Architecture Test Site

I make this test website for the Universit√† Ca' Foscari's Computer Architecture course.
Each lesson-related document shows when, in lesson.json, the _when_ field of each document is greater or equal than today's date.
Each menu php page contains just the content and the related PHP (like lessons one to show lessons documents).
